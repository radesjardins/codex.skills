# Review Plan — implementation plan quality audit

**Codex path rule:** Resolve the plugin root as the directory two levels above this
`SKILL.md`. Every `references/` and `scripts/` path below is relative to that root;
convert it to an absolute path before running a script.

Audit an existing `plan.md` in two layers:

1. **Mechanical** via `scripts/plan-lint.py` — required sections, per-task field
   presence, dependency resolution, no vague language. Deterministic; no LLM judgment.
2. **Judgment** via the `risk-assessor` agent — anti-pattern scanning, architecture
   concerns, rollback quality, checkpoint placement, TDD strategy.

This is the quality gate between planning and execution. It does not write durable docs
and does not modify the plan unless explicitly authorized (Step 5).

## Workflow

### 1. Locate the plan

If a path was provided, read it. Otherwise detect the plan in order:
`docs/plan.md`, `docs/planning/current-execution.md`,
`docs/planning/current.md`, root `PLAN.md`. Read it completely.

If none exists, report that there's no plan to review and recommend `rad-plan:plan`.

### 2. Mechanical lint

Use `python3`, or `python` on Windows:

```bash
python3 <plugin-root>/scripts/plan-lint.py <plan-path> --json
```

Parse the JSON. It reports missing required sections, tasks missing any of the six
fields (Objective, Files, Depends on, Done when, Validate, Rollback), unresolved or
cyclic dependencies, and vague language. Exit 1 = issues, 0 = clean. These findings are
deterministic and **bypass the risk-assessor** — they feed straight into the report.

### 3. Delegate to risk-assessor

Spawn one bounded Codex subagent named `risk_assessor` with `fork_turns: all`, using
the substituted template from `references/subagent-prompts/risk-assessment.md`.
Require JSON-only output and no file edits. Substitute `{plugin_root}` with the
absolute plugin root. Pass the plan content,
`iteration_number: 1`, `max_iterations: 1` (review-plan is a single pass; the iterative
loop belongs to `rad-plan:plan`), and a note that the mechanical layer already ran —
focus judgment on what scripts can't check (anti-patterns, architecture, rollback
quality, checkpoint placement, TDD strategy).

If durable context docs exist and are relevant (e.g. a `docs/prd.md`,
`docs/architecture.md`, a decision log), read them read-only and pass them as supporting
context so the assessor judges the plan against stated product/architecture intent. Do
not require them — many projects won't have them.

Validate the agent's JSON:

```bash
echo "$SUBAGENT_OUTPUT" | python3 <plugin-root>/scripts/validate-json.py \
  <plugin-root>/references/subagent-prompts/risk-assessment.schema.json - --extract-from-markdown
```

Re-prompt once on schema failure, then fall back to markdown parsing against the
prompt contract. Key fields: `verdict` (`APPROVE` | `REVISE` | `RETHINK`),
`blocking_issues[]`, `advisory_issues[]`, `escalation_required`.

### 4. Present results

```markdown
# Plan Review Report

**Plan:** [path]
**Mechanical lint:** [PASS | N issues]
**Risk-assessor verdict:** APPROVE | REVISE | RETHINK
**Overall recommendation:** [actionable next step]

## Mechanical issues (from plan-lint.py)
- [deterministic — no judgment debate]

## Critical issues (block execution until fixed)
- [issue with specific fix]

## Improvements (recommended before execution)
- [issue with fix]

## Optional enhancements
- [nice-to-have]

## Escalation
[only when verdict=RETHINK — recommend rad-brainstormer:design-sprint]
```

Apply production-grade standards by default: every task needs both Validate and
Rollback; auth/payment/data tasks need a security checkpoint; external integrations need
error handling in the task spec. Treat gaps in these as blocking.

**Horizon rule:** task-level detail is required only for the "Now" horizon. A Release
map whose "Next"/"Later" entries are outlines and themes is **correct by design** — do
not flag them as under-specified. A `## Shipped` section is history — out of review
scope entirely.

### 5. Offer fixes (only when authorized)

If `verdict` is `REVISE`, offer to fix issues directly in the plan file. For each fix,
explain the change, show before/after, and modify **only** `plan.md` — never create
implementation files, never write durable docs. Mechanical issues (missing field, vague
phrase) usually have unambiguous fixes; offer to apply those directly.

If `verdict` is `RETHINK`, do not offer fixes — the architecture has fundamental issues
task-level edits won't resolve. Recommend `rad-brainstormer:design-sprint`, then
re-review.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not modify the plan unless authorized in Step 5.
- Does not write durable docs (PRD, architecture, decision log) — if the review surfaces
  a durable change, name it in the report for the user to apply.
- Does not test that the plan works — that's the executor's job.
- Does not re-run the iterative risk loop — that belongs to `rad-plan:plan`.
