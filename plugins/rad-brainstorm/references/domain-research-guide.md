# Domain Research Guide

This reference guides the domain-researcher agent in quickly becoming informed enough to be a useful brainstorming partner in any domain. It covers what to research, how deep to go, and how to present findings.

## Why Domain Research Matters

The mechanism is straightforward: broader information inputs create more combinatorial possibilities for novel ideas. Domain context turns generic ideation into grounded ideation.

Without domain context, brainstorming produces generic ideas that:
- Miss industry-specific opportunities and constraints
- Repeat solutions that have already been tried and failed
- Ignore regulatory or technical realities
- Lack the specificity needed for real implementation
- Sound impressive but aren't actionable

Even 5-10 minutes of targeted research dramatically improves brainstorming quality by grounding ideation in the reality of the domain. The brainstormer doesn't need to become a domain expert - it needs to become an informed conversationalist who knows enough to ask the right questions and recognize promising directions.

## What to Research

For any brainstorming domain, the researcher should gather information across seven dimensions.

### 1. Landscape Overview

**What to find:** Major players, market size, market trends, recent disruptions, key segments.

**Research questions:**
- Who are the top 5-10 companies or organizations in this space?
- How large is the market (users, revenue, growth rate)?
- What are the major trends shaping this space right now?
- Has anything disrupted this space in the last 2-3 years?
- What are the major segments or sub-categories?

**Why it matters:** Prevents brainstorming ideas that already exist, identifies white space, and reveals the competitive dynamics that shape what's possible.

### 2. Common Approaches

**What to find:** How this problem is typically solved today, the dominant methodologies, standard tools and practices.

**Research questions:**
- What's the "default" solution that most people use?
- What are the top 3-5 approaches, and how do they differ?
- What technology stack or tools are standard in this space?
- Is there an industry standard or best practice?
- What's the "boring but works" solution?

**Why it matters:** You need to know the baseline before you can improve on it. Common approaches reveal what's already been validated and where the ceiling of current thinking sits.

### 3. Pain Points

**What to find:** What practitioners, users, and customers complain about most, unmet needs, frustrations with existing solutions.

**Research questions:**
- What are the top complaints about existing solutions?
- What workarounds do people use because current tools fall short?
- What feature requests keep appearing in forums, reviews, and support tickets?
- What do practitioners wish someone would build?
- Where do people lose the most time, money, or energy?

**Where to look:** Reddit discussions, G2/Capterra reviews, Stack Overflow threads, Twitter complaints, Hacker News discussions, industry forums, support documentation for competing products.

**Why it matters:** Pain points are where innovation opportunities live. Every complaint is a potential "How Might We" statement.

### 4. Regulatory and Compliance Constraints

**What to find:** Legal requirements, industry regulations, compliance standards, data privacy rules, licensing requirements.

**Research questions:**
- What regulations govern this space (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, FDA, etc.)?
- Are there licensing or certification requirements?
- What are the data privacy implications?
- Are there pending regulatory changes that could affect solutions?
- What are the liability considerations?

**Why it matters:** The most creative idea in the world is worthless if it's illegal. Regulatory constraints are non-negotiable and must be known before brainstorming, not discovered after. They also shape the solution space in ways that can create competitive moats (compliance is hard, so it's a barrier to entry).

### 5. Recent Innovations

**What to find:** New products, technologies, approaches, or business models from the last 1-2 years.

**Research questions:**
- What new products or companies have launched recently?
- What new technologies are being applied to this space?
- What approaches are being tested that haven't been tried before?
- Are there any breakthrough research papers or demonstrations?
- What are the "up and coming" startups doing differently?

**Why it matters:** Recent innovations show where the frontier is moving. They also reveal what's becoming possible that wasn't before, opening new solution spaces for brainstorming.

### 6. Adjacent Domains

**What to find:** Related fields that face similar challenges and may have transferable solutions.

**Research questions:**
- What other domains face a structurally similar problem?
- Have any of those domains found elegant solutions?
- What principles from those solutions could transfer?
- Are there emerging technologies in adjacent fields that haven't been applied here yet?
- What does this domain look like through the lens of [different industry]?

**Examples of adjacent domain transfers:**
- Healthcare scheduling problems are similar to airline crew scheduling
- E-commerce recommendation engines draw from academic paper citation networks
- Traffic management parallels network packet routing
- Restaurant kitchen workflows mirror manufacturing assembly lines
- Classroom teaching techniques inform UX onboarding flows

**Why it matters:** Cross-domain analogies are the source of many breakthrough innovations. Most problems have already been solved somewhere - just not in this specific context.

### 7. Failed Approaches

**What to find:** What has been tried before and didn't work, and critically, WHY it failed.

**Research questions:**
- What products or companies in this space have failed? Why?
- What approaches did experts predict would work but didn't?
- Are there "obvious" solutions that have been tried and abandoned?
- What does the post-mortem analysis say about past failures?
- What conditions would need to change for a previously failed approach to work now?

**Why it matters:** Knowing what failed prevents repeating mistakes. But more importantly, understanding WHY something failed often reveals that the timing, technology, or market conditions were wrong - and those conditions may have changed. Many successful products are "failed" ideas whose time has come.

## Research Depth Levels

Not every brainstorming session requires the same depth of research. Match the investment to the stakes and the facilitator's existing knowledge.

| Level | Searches | Time | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick scan** | 2-3 searches | 3-5 minutes | Familiar domain, just need to verify current state. The facilitator already knows the fundamentals and needs a refresh on recent developments. |
| **Standard** | 5-7 searches | 10-15 minutes | Unfamiliar domain, need working knowledge. The facilitator doesn't know the space well enough to ask informed questions or recognize good ideas. |
| **Deep dive** | 10-15 searches | 20-30 minutes | Complex or regulated domain, high-stakes decisions, or the user is an expert who will notice gaps in knowledge. Also appropriate when the brainstorming outcome will directly influence significant investment. |

### Quick Scan Research Plan

1. Search for "[domain] market overview 2025-2026"
2. Search for "[domain] biggest challenges" or "[domain] pain points"
3. Search for "[domain] recent news" or "[domain] latest developments"

### Standard Research Plan

1. Search for "[domain] market overview"
2. Search for "[domain] key players competitors landscape"
3. Search for "[domain] common solutions approaches"
4. Search for "[domain] biggest pain points challenges"
5. Search for "[domain] regulations compliance requirements"
6. Search for "[domain] recent innovations new technology"
7. Search for "[domain] failed products lessons learned"

### Deep Dive Research Plan

All of the standard plan, plus:
8. Search for "[domain] adjacent industries transferable solutions"
9. Search for "[domain] user complaints reviews" (check Reddit, G2, forums)
10. Search for "[domain] research papers recent findings"
11. Search for "[domain] startups disrupting"
12. Search for "[domain] expert predictions trends"
13. Search for specific competitors or products mentioned in earlier results
14. Search for regulatory details on any compliance requirements found
15. Verify and cross-reference key claims from earlier searches

## When NOT to Research

Research is valuable but not always necessary. Skip or abbreviate in these situations:

**The user is the domain expert and has already provided extensive context.**
If the user has described the landscape, players, constraints, and opportunities, additional research may be redundant or even insulting. Instead, ask: "You've given me a thorough picture. Is there anything specific I should look into, or should we dive straight into brainstorming?"

**The brainstorming is about a personal or creative topic with no "domain."**
"I want to brainstorm birthday party ideas for my partner" doesn't need market research. It needs personal preferences, constraints, and creativity.

**The user explicitly says not to research.**
Respect this: "Don't research, I'll tell you what you need to know." The user may have proprietary knowledge they can't share through research channels, or they may simply want to move fast.

**The topic is well within general knowledge and doesn't need current data.**
"How to improve team communication" doesn't require researching the communication tool market unless the brainstorming is specifically about tools. General organizational challenges are well-understood.

**Time is extremely limited.**
If the user signals urgency ("I need ideas in the next 10 minutes"), skip research and brainstorm with available knowledge. Note any gaps: "I'm brainstorming without researching the current landscape - let me know if I'm missing something industry-specific."

---

## Staying Current During the Session

Research isn't a one-time event at the beginning. The brainstormer should periodically check whether new information would help, especially when:

### Trigger Points for Mid-Session Research

**When a specific competitor or product comes up:**
> "Should I look into what [competitor] is doing in this space? It might reveal opportunities or constraints we should know about."

**When the discussion enters unfamiliar technical territory:**
> "I'm not confident about how [specific technology/regulation/process] works in practice. Want me to check before we build ideas on it?"

**When the user makes a claim the brainstormer can't verify:**
> "You mentioned that [claim]. I want to make sure we're building on solid ground - should I verify that, or are you confident based on your experience?"

**When an idea requires understanding current market conditions:**
> "This idea depends on [market condition]. Want me to check the current state of things before we develop it further?"

**When the brainstorming pivots to an unexpected domain:**
> "We've moved into [new domain] territory. I know less about this area - want me to do a quick scan before we continue?"

### How to Offer Research Without Breaking Flow

The key is to make research offers feel like a natural part of the conversation, not an interruption:

- Frame as optional: "I could look into that if it would help, or we can keep going with what we know."
- Estimate time: "A quick search would take me about 2 minutes. Worth it, or should we press on?"
- Explain the value: "Knowing what [specific thing] might help us avoid a dead end."
- Never insist: if the user says "let's keep going," respect that immediately.

### Integrating Research Results Mid-Session

When research returns during a brainstorming session, integrate it naturally:

- "I just found that [insight]. Does that match your experience?"
- "Interesting - turns out [recent development]. That actually opens up a new angle for us."
- "One thing to watch out for: [constraint from research]. We should factor that into our ideas."
- "The research confirms your instinct about [user statement]. And it adds [additional detail] that might be useful."

Never dump a full research brief mid-session. Extract the 2-3 most relevant findings and weave them into the conversation.

## Research Ethics and Accuracy

### Honesty About Knowledge Limits

The brainstormer should be transparent about what it knows and doesn't know:
- "I'm drawing on general knowledge here - I haven't verified this against current data."
- "This was true as of my last update, but the situation may have changed."
- "I'm not sure about this specific claim. Shall I research it before we rely on it?"

### Avoiding Fabrication

When research doesn't find clear answers:
- Report the gap: "I couldn't find reliable data on [specific question]."
- Suggest alternatives: "The user might know this from direct experience, or we could brainstorm without this data point and validate later."
- Never fabricate statistics, company names, or specific claims to fill gaps.

### Source Quality

Prefer, in order:
1. Industry reports and market research (Gartner, Forrester, CB Insights, etc.)
2. Company announcements and official documentation
3. Reputable news sources (TechCrunch, Bloomberg, domain-specific publications)
4. Expert analysis and opinion pieces
5. Community discussions (Reddit, HN, forums) - valuable for pain points and user sentiment, but treat claims as anecdotal
6. Social media - useful for trend-spotting, unreliable for facts

### Timeliness

Always check the publication date of sources. In fast-moving domains (AI, crypto, social media), information from even 6 months ago can be outdated. Flag when relying on potentially stale information.
