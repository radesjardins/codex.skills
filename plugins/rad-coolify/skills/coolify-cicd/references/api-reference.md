# Coolify REST API v1 Reference

> **Honest framing on API stability.** The API is versioned at `/api/v1` but has no formal stability guarantee — Coolify itself is `v4.0.0-beta.474` (April 2026). The OpenAPI spec and actual API behavior occasionally diverge. Two known active bugs as of April 2026:
> - **Issue #7702**: `GET /api/v1/projects` is documented to return an `environments` array per project, but the actual response does not include it.
> - **Issue #8782**: `POST /api/v1/services` rejects the documented `urls` parameter with HTTP 422.
>
> **For production automation, pin to a specific Coolify version and test API calls against your instance** before building tooling on top. The `@radoriginllc/coolify-mcp` server (bundled with this plugin) wraps these endpoints — when the underlying API changes, update the MCP package rather than re-implementing the wrapper.

## Base URL

```
https://<COOLIFY_FQDN>/api/v1
```

## Authorization

All endpoints require the `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header. Tokens are generated in the Coolify UI under **Settings > Keys & Tokens > API Tokens**, scoped to a team, with permission levels:

- **read-only** (default) — read access to non-sensitive fields
- **read:sensitive** — includes env vars, secrets, connection strings
- **view:sensitive** — view-only access to sensitive fields
- **`*`** (full CRUD) — all operations
- **deploy** — deploy-only (trigger deployments, no other writes)

**New in beta.474 (April 2026):** Tokens now support optional **expiration dates**. For long-running CI/CD integrations, set an expiration aligned with your secret rotation policy and refresh before it elapses.

## Common API Patterns

### Poll for Deployment Completion

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# poll-deploy.sh — wait for deployment to finish

APP_UUID="$1"
DEPLOY_UUID="$2"
COOLIFY_URL="$3"
TOKEN="$4"

while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s \
    "${COOLIFY_URL}/api/v1/applications/${APP_UUID}/deployments/${DEPLOY_UUID}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq -r '.status')
  
  case "$STATUS" in
    "finished") echo "Deployment succeeded"; exit 0 ;;
    "failed")   echo "Deployment failed"; exit 1 ;;
    "cancelled") echo "Deployment cancelled"; exit 1 ;;
    *) echo "Status: $STATUS — waiting..."; sleep 15 ;;
  esac
done
```

### Deploy and Wait (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
- name: Deploy and wait
  run: |
    # Trigger deploy
    RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST \
      "${{ secrets.COOLIFY_URL }}/api/v1/applications/${{ secrets.APP_UUID }}/deploy" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json")
    
    DEPLOY_UUID=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.deployment_uuid')
    echo "Deployment started: $DEPLOY_UUID"
    
    # Poll for completion (max 5 minutes)
    for i in $(seq 1 20); do
      sleep 15
      STATUS=$(curl -s \
        "${{ secrets.COOLIFY_URL }}/api/v1/applications/${{ secrets.APP_UUID }}/deployments/$DEPLOY_UUID" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}" | jq -r '.status')
      
      echo "Attempt $i: $STATUS"
      
      if [ "$STATUS" = "finished" ]; then
        echo "Deploy succeeded!"
        exit 0
      elif [ "$STATUS" = "failed" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "cancelled" ]; then
        echo "Deploy failed with status: $STATUS"
        exit 1
      fi
    done
    
    echo "Deploy timed out"
    exit 1
```

## Rate Limits

The Coolify API does not document explicit rate limits for self-hosted instances, but:
- Avoid polling more frequently than every 10-15 seconds
- Batch operations where possible
- Use webhooks for event-driven workflows instead of polling
