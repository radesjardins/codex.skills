# Coolify Deployments

Covers build pack selection, deployment configuration, rolling-update strategies, rollbacks, and registry-based deploys for Coolify v4 self-hosted.

> **Coolify Cloud vs Self-Hosted.** All content assumes self-hosted Coolify v4.x. Coolify Cloud (launched 2025, $5/month + $3/month per server) is a managed control plane and may differ in available options and defaults.

> **Coolify v4 is a rolling beta.** As of April 2026 the latest release is `v4.0.0-beta.474` (~474 betas over 2 years). The v4.0.0 stable milestone has not been closed. Treat the API and UI as evolving — pin to a specific Coolify version for production automation.

> **Coolify v5 is in early development.** Announced April 2025 with a full PHP rewrite and Vue/Inertia UI. No release date. v4 continues to receive uninterrupted releases.

## Build Pack Selection Decision Tree

```
START: What are you deploying?
│
├─ Multi-container app (needs multiple services)?
│  └─► Docker Compose
│      Trigger: docker-compose.yml or compose.yml exists at repo root
│
├─ Have a Dockerfile already?
│  └─► Dockerfile build pack
│      Trigger: Dockerfile present, or custom build process needed
│
├─ Deploying a pre-built image from a registry?
│  └─► Pre-built Image (Docker Image)
│      Trigger: Image already built in CI, deploying from GHCR/DockerHub/private registry
│
├─ Static site (HTML/CSS/JS only, no server needed)?
│  └─► Static build pack
│      Trigger: Purely static output, no backend, SPA or marketing site
│      Note: Use Nixpacks instead if the framework has its own build step (Next.js static export, Astro SSG)
│
├─ Standard app (single process, common language)?
│  └─► Nixpacks (default)
│      Trigger: package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.
│      Nixpacks auto-detects language and builds accordingly
│
└─ None of the above?
   └─► Write a Dockerfile manually
       Nixpacks detection may fail for uncommon stacks, polyglot repos, or custom runtimes
```

### Nixpacks Detection Signals

Nixpacks determines the build plan from files at the repo root (or configured base directory):

| File | Detected As | Runtime |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `package.json` | Node.js | Node LTS |
| `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `Pipfile` | Python | Python 3.x |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby | Ruby latest |
| `go.mod` | Go | Go latest |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | Rust stable |
| `composer.json` | PHP | PHP 8.x |
| `mix.exs` | Elixir | Elixir latest |
| `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` | Java | JDK 17+ |
| `.swift` files | Swift | Swift latest |
| `*.csproj` | .NET | .NET 8+ |

### Railpack (NOT YET in Coolify as of April 2026)

Railpack is Railway's successor to Nixpacks, currently in Beta upstream (railpack.com). It aims to produce smaller, faster images and supports newer runtime versions that Nixpacks (now in maintenance mode) lags on.

**Coolify status:** Railpack is **not yet a build pack option in Coolify** — the official build packs page lists only Nixpacks, Static, Dockerfile, Docker Compose. Active community discussion threads (GitHub Discussion #5282, #5519, Issue #7983) track the request for Coolify to add Railpack support; no merged PR or shipped UI option as of April 2026.

**When you need newer runtimes than Nixpacks supports:** Switch to a Dockerfile build pack. You can install Railpack inside the Dockerfile if you want, but it's not surfaced as a Coolify-managed build pack.

### Reverse Proxy: Traefik (default) vs Caddy (experimental alternative)

Coolify ships **Traefik** as the default reverse proxy. **Caddy** was added as an experimental alternative at beta.237 and now has its own docs section.

**Use Traefik (default) unless:**
- You specifically want Caddy's automatic HTTPS / on-the-fly cert provisioning model
- You want DNS challenge support that's simpler than Traefik's

**Switching proxies has caveats:** resources created before beta.237 require label migration to switch from Traefik to Caddy. Caddy is still flagged experimental by the Coolify team — Traefik has more battle-tested production usage.

The troubleshooting flows in `coolify-troubleshoot/SKILL.md` are written against Traefik. Caddy users should consult the Caddy section of Coolify docs for proxy-specific debugging.

## Deployment Configuration

### Key Configuration Fields

| Field | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Build Pack** | Nixpacks / Dockerfile / Docker Compose / Docker Image / Static | Auto-detected |
| **Base Directory** | Subdirectory containing the app (for monorepos) | `/` (repo root) |
| **Build Command** | Override the build step | Auto-detected by Nixpacks |
| **Install Command** | Override dependency installation | Auto-detected |
| **Start Command** | Override the process start command | Auto-detected |
| **Watch Paths** | Paths that trigger rebuild on change (webhook mode) | Entire repo |
| **Port** | Port the app listens on inside the container | `3000` |
| **Health Check Path** | HTTP path for health verification | `/` (if health check enabled) |
| **Dockerfile Location** | Path to Dockerfile (if using Dockerfile build pack) | `Dockerfile` |
| **Docker Compose Location** | Path to compose file | `docker-compose.yml` |

### Build-Time vs Runtime Environment Variables

Coolify separates environment variables into two scopes:

- **Build-time**: Available during `docker build` (injected as `ARG`). Use for: npm tokens, build flags, API keys needed at compile time.
- **Runtime**: Available when the container runs (injected as `ENV`). Use for: database URLs, API keys, secrets the running app needs.

**Common mistakes**:
1. Putting a runtime-only secret as build-time — it gets baked into the image layer and is visible via `docker history`
2. Forgetting that Nixpacks build-time vars require the `NIXPACKS_` prefix for build configuration overrides
3. Not realizing that build-time variables appear in build logs by default

### NIXPACKS_* Override System

Force specific runtimes, versions, or commands via `NIXPACKS_*` environment variables (e.g., `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION=20`, `NIXPACKS_BUILD_CMD`, `NIXPACKS_PKGS`). See `references/build-packs.md` for the full variable table and `nixpacks.toml` configuration.

### Monorepo Pattern

For monorepos where only one subdirectory should build:

1. Set **Base Directory** to the app's subdirectory (e.g., `apps/web`)
2. Nixpacks will look for `package.json` (or equivalent) in that subdirectory
3. If using Dockerfile, set **Dockerfile Location** relative to repo root
4. Set **Watch Paths** to the subdirectory to avoid rebuilds on unrelated changes
5. Build context is the repo root; base directory controls where Nixpacks looks for the app

### Pre/Post Deployment Scripts

Execute custom scripts before or after the main deployment:

- **Pre-deployment**: Run database migrations, warm caches, notify services. Executes before the new container receives traffic.
- **Post-deployment**: Clean up old resources, send notifications, update external registries. Executes after successful deployment.

Configure in the application settings under the deployment section. Scripts run in the container context.

## Rolling Deployments and Rollbacks

> **Honest framing on "zero-downtime."** Coolify's rolling deploy gives effectively-zero-downtime **only when all of these conditions hold**: single-container deployment (NOT docker-compose), no exclusive host port bindings, healthcheck configured and passing reliably, persistent volumes either absent or attachable to multiple containers simultaneously. When any condition fails, Coolify falls back to a recreate strategy (brief downtime) — and there's an open Coolify issue (#8627, late 2025) about rolling updates causing intermittent 502/503s in some configurations. Don't market deploys as "zero-downtime" to stakeholders without verifying the conditions and watching the metric.

### Rolling Deployment Flow

1. New container is built and started alongside the old one
2. Coolify runs health checks against the new container
3. If health check passes → Traefik routes traffic to new container, old container is stopped and removed
4. If health check fails → New container is stopped, old container keeps serving traffic, deployment marked as failed

**Health check configuration**: Set a health check path (e.g., `/healthz` or `/api/health`). Coolify uses HTTP health checks — the endpoint must return a 2xx status. **The endpoint should check actual dependencies** (DB connection, cache reachability) — a healthcheck that just returns `200 OK` regardless of state defeats the purpose.

### When Rolling Deploy Does NOT Apply

Coolify falls back to **recreate** strategy (stop old, start new — brief downtime) when:

- The application uses persistent volumes that cannot be mounted on two containers simultaneously
- Docker Compose deployments (managed by Docker Compose lifecycle, not Coolify's rolling logic)
- Health checks are not configured (no way to verify new container is ready)
- The container requires exclusive port binding on the host (not through Traefik)
- Swarm mode deployments (use Swarm's own rolling update mechanism — and watch for Issue #8299, old container accumulation in Swarm rolling updates as of Feb 2026)

### Rollbacks

**Via UI**: Navigate to the application → Deployments tab → click the "Rollback" button on any previous successful deployment. This redeploys the image/commit from that deployment.

**Via API**:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://<COOLIFY_FQDN>/api/v1/applications/<APP_UUID>/restart" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tag": "<PREVIOUS_IMAGE_TAG>"}'
```

**Persistent storage**: Volumes are preserved across deployments. Define volumes in the application's storage settings to persist data between deploys (database files, uploads, etc.).

## Pre-Built Image Deployment (Registry Pattern)

### Workflow

1. **Configure a Docker Registry** in Coolify (Settings → Docker Registries) — provide registry URL, username, and password/token
2. **Create an application** → choose "Docker Image" as the build pack
3. **Set the image** field to the full image reference: `ghcr.io/org/app:latest` or `registry.example.com/app:v1.2.3`
4. **Deploy** — Coolify pulls the image from the registry and runs it

### Image Tag Behavior

- Coolify pulls the image on every deploy (does not cache across deploys)
- Use `latest` tag for always-deploy-newest workflows (webhook-triggered)
- Pin specific tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`) for controlled deployments
- Coolify resolves image digests — even `:latest` will detect if the image changed

### Private Registry Authentication

Credentials are stored in Coolify's encrypted database. Configure once per registry:
- **GHCR**: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `read:packages` scope
- **Docker Hub**: Use a Docker Hub access token
- **Custom Registry**: Provide username and password/token for your registry

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence |
|-------------|-------------|
| Using `latest` tag in production without a webhook trigger | Deployments don't auto-update; you get stale images |
| Putting secrets as build-time env vars when only needed at runtime | Secrets baked into image layers, visible in `docker history` |
| Not setting a health check path for zero-downtime deploys | Coolify uses recreate strategy; causes downtime |
| Setting base directory wrong in monorepos (relative vs absolute) | Build fails or wrong app is built |
| Overriding Nixpacks start command without testing locally | Container starts but crashes; silent failures |
| Using Docker Compose build pack for a single-container app | Unnecessary complexity; use Nixpacks or Dockerfile instead |
| Not pinning Node/Python version via NIXPACKS_*_VERSION | Builds break when Nixpacks bumps the default runtime |
| Ignoring build cache — forcing clean builds on every deploy | 3-10x slower builds, unnecessary registry bandwidth |
| Running database migrations in the Dockerfile | Migrations run at build time, not deploy time; may fail or run against wrong DB |
| Using `--privileged` containers for convenience | Major security risk; almost never required |

## Check Configuration Edits

After changing a Dockerfile or Compose file for this task, offer the matching bundled validator when it would add value. Run it only with the user's approved project path. A finding exit code of `1` means the validator found issues and is valid output.

Resolve the plugin root from this `SKILL.md`, then run one focused command:

```powershell
python <plugin-root>\scripts\lint-dockerfile.py <changed-file> --json
python <plugin-root>\scripts\lint-compose.py <changed-file> --json
```
