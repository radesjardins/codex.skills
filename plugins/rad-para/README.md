# rad-para — Codex workflows that actively manage your PARA second brain

Most PARA tools tell you about the methodology. rad-para implements it for you — organizing notes, running weekly reviews, distilling raw captures into usable knowledge, and maintaining continuity between sessions via the Hemingway Bridge pattern. Based on Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain.
