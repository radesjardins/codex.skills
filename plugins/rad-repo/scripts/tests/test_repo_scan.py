"""Regression test: repo-scan.py's floating-doc allowlist must track the shelf.

Background (2026-06-19): find_floating() allowed only the three core doc names
under docs/, so it flagged model-sanctioned docs as "floating" — crying wolf, the
exact thing its docstring promises it never does. The fix added ALLOWED_DOCS.

v2 (2026-07-02): the doc model is the shelf (references/shelf-spec.md). This test
pins the contract so it can't silently drift: the shelf filenames are read
*straight out of* shelf-spec.md's shelf table, and every docs/<name>.md the spec
shelves must NOT be flagged. Add a doc to the shelf without teaching the scan
about it and this test goes red.

It also keeps the scan honest in the other direction — genuinely off-shelf docs
must still be flagged, the glob must stay shallow, and the L0/L1 size budgets
must fire.

Plain stdlib; no pytest. Override the script under test with REPO_SCAN_PY (used to
prove the test has teeth against the pre-fix logic).

Run:  python test_repo_scan.py     (exits non-zero on failure)
