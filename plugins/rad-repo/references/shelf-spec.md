# The shelf spec — the single source for the doc model

This file is THE contract. Every skill in this plugin, rad-plan, rad-brainstormer,
and any other tool that writes docs in a managed repo conforms to what's written here.
Skills reference this file; they never restate it. The repo itself carries a ~10-line
summary (the doc-model block in `AGENTS.md`, stamped by `/rad-repo:repo-init`)
so the contract travels with the repo across machines and harnesses.

The idea in one sentence: **a closed system** — every kind of information has exactly
one home, every home has exactly one update trigger, and nothing depends on anyone
remembering anything.

## The context stack

Five layers, ordered by how often they're loaded. L0 + L1 together are ~1.5–2k tokens
(a token is roughly ¾ of a word) — cheap enough to inject into every session.

| Layer | File(s) | Role | Size budget | Loaded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | root + scoped `AGENTS.md` | root defaults plus material subtree overlays | root ≤40 lines; scoped concise | `startup`, then by target path |
| L1 | `docs/handoff.md` | state: where we are, what's next, the `## Deferred — do not re-raise` ledger | ≤60 lines | `startup`, `wrapup`, `ship` |
| L2 | `docs/decisions.md` | settled decisions, append-only | 1 line each | checked before re-litigating |
| L3 | `docs/prd.md`, `docs/plan.md`, `docs/initiatives/*.md` | direction plus approved finite migrations | none | when planning or executing that initiative |
| L4 | `docs/archive/` | everything superseded | unbounded | never by default |

**Convention:** the root `AGENTS.md` carries repository-wide defaults. A scoped
`AGENTS.md` is allowed only where a subtree has materially different commands,
constraints, ownership, or generated-code rules; the closest file wins and must not
duplicate root facts. Root budgets are enforced by the mechanical scans (`repo-align`
routes overflow down the stack — an L0 rule
that's really a lesson goes to `docs/lessons.md`, durable handoff content goes
to `plan.md`, and so on).

## The shelf

A **closed** set of reference docs. No doc exists until its trigger fires; every doc
declares who updates it and when. Anything that isn't one of these kinds goes to
`docs/archive/`, lives as a **satellite** (below), or doesn't get written.

| File | Holds | Created when | Updated when / by | Freshness check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/decisions.md` | settled choices + one-line why — this **is** the decision-record system (no separate ADR directory; an ADR is just a written record of a decision and why) | first decision | anyone appends; never edited | append-only = never stale |
| `docs/ideas.md` | ideas, pivots, cut features — the parking lot | first idea | anyone appends; `/rad-plan:replan` annotates rejections | consumed at `/rad-plan:replan` |
| `docs/lessons.md` | mistakes worth remembering; doubles as a learning journal | first lesson | wrapup question appends | append-only |
| `docs/design.md` | **sole source of the design system**: brand, UI tokens, layout/visual specs | UI work begins | when a visual/design decision is settled — recorded here, not in decisions.md | align cross-check |
| `docs/architecture.md` | how the system hangs together (1 page + diagram) | repo gains >1 moving part | when a decisions.md entry touches structure; align nudges | align cross-check |
| `docs/api.md` | endpoint inventory | repo exposes an API **now** (not "Later") | route change | **mechanical**: align diffs routes in code vs the doc |
| `docs/handoff.md` | state + deferred ledger | repo-init | overwritten by wrapup/ship only | ≤3 commits behind in startup trust report |
| `docs/prd.md` | goal + releases, owner's voice, plain language | `/rad-plan:plan` interview | owner, at replan boundaries | reviewed at replan |
| `docs/plan.md` | milestones + tasks | `/rad-plan:plan` | planner only (`/plan`, `/replan`) | re-baselined per milestone |

**Transient spec docs** (`docs/<date>-*-spec.md` / `docs/<date>-*-design.md`, written
by rad-brainstormer) are the one sanctioned pass-through: each names
`/rad-plan:plan` as its consumer in its header and is archived once planning has
consumed it. They are not shelf docs — a spec still sitting under `docs/` after its
plan exists is a loose end.

**Satellite docs.** Domain reference docs with no shelf slot (a test runbook, a
data-format contract, a domain model) stay in `docs/` as satellites: each is linked
from the nearest core doc (architecture.md, api.md, or AGENTS.md's doc-model table)
so nothing is orphaned. Satellites are legitimate residents, not loose ends — a loose
end is a doc *nothing links to*.

**Conformance without loss.** The shelf's formats govern *new* entries, not existing
knowledge. When adopt/align meets content richer than a shelf format (e.g. a detailed
symptom/cause/fix lessons file), the shelf file becomes the append surface going
forward and the rich original stays live as a linked satellite (the
`docs/lessons-detail.md` pattern) — never compressed to one-liners, never archived
while still useful. Mapping names and locations is conformance; flattening content is
loss.

## File formats

**decisions.md** — `# Decisions` header, then append-only one-line dated entries.
Never edit an existing line; to overturn a decision, append a new entry (and ask the
owner first — see the interaction contract).

```
# Decisions

- 2026-06-20 · thumbnails: square crops in grids, true aspect ratio in lightbox (settled after 3 sessions)
- 2026-06-07 · "push to main" always means push to origin/main
```

A paragraph of context is allowed for expensive decisions — same file, still
append-only, no separate directory. Settled *visual/design* decisions go to
`docs/design.md` instead; decisions.md may cross-reference design.md but never
duplicates its content.

**ideas.md** — `# Ideas` header, append-only one-line dated entries. When
`/rad-plan:replan` rejects a parked idea it appends a `rejected: <why>` line under
the entry — the idea stays on record so it doesn't get re-proposed.

```
# Ideas

- 2026-06-19 · offline mode for the field app
  - rejected: 2026-06-28 — sync complexity outweighs demand; revisit if users ask
```

**lessons.md** — `# Lessons` header, append-only one-line dated entries: what bit,
and the fix or rule that prevents it.

```
# Lessons

- 2026-06-12 · Coolify healthcheck path must match the app's route — a 404 healthcheck loops the deploy forever
```

**handoff.md** — overwritten (never appended) by wrapup/ship, ≤60 lines: Last
completed / Current focus / Next action / Validation / Watchouts, plus the deferred
ledger, carried forward verbatim on every overwrite:

```
## Deferred — do not re-raise
- 14 unassigned drafts (owner aware; wake: when count > 30)
- <item> (wake: <condition or never>)
```

Startup, wrapup, ship, and repo-align treat this section as a suppression filter: an item
listed here is not re-raised until its wake condition (the condition after `wake:`)
is met. `wake: never` means never.

**prd.md** — headings: `Goal`, `Users & primary workflow`, `Releases` (Now / Next /
Later), `Non-goals`, `Acceptance criteria`. Owner's voice, plain language, present
tense.

**plan.md** — `Objective` (carrying an `**End goal:**` line that echoes the PRD
Goal), a `Milestones` table whose columns are `# | Milestone | Ships | Key
artifacts`, and `Tasks` (T1…). Written only by the planner.

**initiatives/*.md** — an approved, finite migration or cross-cutting change that
would overload plan.md. Each file uses `templates/initiative.md`: frontmatter carries
title, owner, active status, baseline commit, plan link, retirement condition, and
archive destination; the body carries acceptance criteria and rollback strategy.
`docs/plan.md` links it. Completion retires it to `docs/archive/`; initiatives are
never permanent topic docs or an alternate roadmap.

**Evidence-tracked current-system docs (optional)** — `architecture.md`, `api.md`, or
another managed doc may use YAML frontmatter with a `tracks:` list of repository
paths. `doc-freshness.py` then reports missing paths and commits touching those paths
since the doc's last commit. This is drift evidence, not semantic proof.

## The vocabulary ladder

One set of names for units of work, used everywhere:

| Term | Means | Lives in | Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | end state of the product | prd.md | 1 per project |
| **Release** | horizon: Now / Next / Later (MVP, V1…) | prd.md + plan.md | 2–4 |
| **Milestone** | shippable chunk within a release (M1, M2…) | plan.md | 3–8 per release |
| **Task** | one work item, ideally one session (T1…) | plan.md | 2–5 per milestone (the planner aims for 2–3; over 5 is a split candidate) |

**Vocabulary profiles** — the default profile reports synonyms such as *phase,
slice, sprint, epic, stage*, and tracked *step* as advisory findings in managed docs.
Repositories configure `.rad-repo.json` to set `vocabulary.mode` to
`advisory`, `strict`, or `off`; `vocabulary.scope` can be `all` or `headings`, and
`banned_terms` can replace the default list. Strict mode makes findings blocking.
A ladder term in the wrong doc is evaluated under the same mode: the PRD speaks only
Goal/Release; plan.md speaks only Milestone/Task.
Brainstorm output inside a repo uses none of the ladder terms (vocabulary quarantine
— sequencing belongs to `/rad-plan:plan` alone).

## One writer per file

One format authority for everything (this file), exactly one writing authority per
file:

| File | Format authority | Content written by | Everyone else |
|---|---|---|---|
| AGENTS.md | repo-manager | repo-manager (operational); planner *proposes* the stack block, owner applies | proposes |
| prd.md | repo-manager (headings) | owner, via the planner interview | proposes edits |
| plan.md | repo-manager (vocabulary) | planner (`/plan`, `/replan`) only | reads |
| initiatives/*.md | repo-manager | initiative owner; align verifies lifecycle metadata | reads |
| decisions.md / ideas.md / lessons.md | repo-manager | anyone **appends**; no one edits | — |
| design.md | repo-manager | agent proposes, owner approves; sole design-system authority | reads, never duplicates |
| handoff.md | repo-manager | wrapup/ship only | reads |
| architecture.md / api.md | repo-manager | planner seeds; decisions/align maintain | proposes |

Each tool polices *format* in the other's lane, never *substance*: align lints
plan.md's vocabulary and stamps but flags content issues to `/rad-plan:replan`
rather than fixing them. rad-brainstormer never writes `docs/design.md`; it routes
rejected/parked ideas to `docs/ideas.md` with a one-line why.

## The enforcement ladder

Instructions come in four strengths. Most systems fail by putting everything at the
weakest level.

| Level | Mechanism | Ignorable? | Capacity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Mechanical check** — code measures it, the agent doesn't guess | no | targeted validators |
| 2 | **Injected rule** — always in context (L0) | rarely | **≤7 hard rules** |
| 3 | **Skill** — loaded when invoked | if not invoked | the commands |
| 4 | **Reference doc** — read on demand | easily | everything else |

**Promotion rule:** an instruction violated or repeated twice gets promoted one level
(chat -> L0 rule; L0 rule -> mechanical check when it can be measured).
**Demotion:** a rule never violated in months moves down to a referenced
guardrails file or the archive.

**Rules audit** (a `repo-align` capability, run on request or when AGENTS.md exceeds
its 40-line budget): classify each existing rule by evidence — violated + mechanical
-> promote to a validator; violated + judgment -> keep in the 7 slots; dormant -> demote to a
referenced guardrails file. Propose-only; the owner decides every move.

## The interaction contract

Stamped into every repo's L0 so every harness inherits the same personality:

1. **Hard gates** — block-and-ask *only* for irreversible or expensive actions: prod
   data, auth, payments, deletes, publishing, plus the owner's protected-changes
   list. Nothing else blocks.
2. **Challenge once, then commit** — on any pivot or risky choice (including
   reversing the owner's own plan), give one honest, short assessment: what changes,
   what it costs or orphans, a recommendation. If the owner confirms, it becomes a
   decision: log it to decisions.md, execute fully, never relitigate, no hedging.
   Real opinion before the decision; total commitment after it. No reflexive praise
   before it, either.
3. **The pressure valve** — mid-session ideas and pivots append to `ideas.md` in
   seconds, block nothing, and get a fair hearing at the next `/rad-plan:replan`.
   Pivots are cheap *because* they're recorded.

Formula: **freedom to decide, obligation to record.**

## Size budgets & trust thresholds

| Check | Budget / threshold | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| AGENTS.md (L0) | ≤40 lines | `repo-scan.py` (every session) |
| handoff.md (L1) | ≤60 lines | `repo-scan.py` (every session) |
| handoff commits-behind | 0–3 green · 4–10 yellow (nudge a quick wrapup) · >10 red (recommend align first) | `doc-freshness.py` trust report |
| prd/plan commits-behind | informational — reviewed at replan boundaries | `doc-freshness.py` trust report |
| decisions/ideas/lessons | append-only — never stale | — |

"Commits-behind" = commits on HEAD since the doc's last modifying commit. Mechanical,
measured by code, not by anyone's memory.

## Domain authority — resolving contradictions

Authority is typed by subject rather than forced into one global ladder:

| Domain | Authority | What it governs |
|---|---|---|
| Current instruction | owner's instruction in the current session | immediate intent; cannot silently rewrite durable constraints |
| Repository constraints | applicable `AGENTS.md`, then decisions/ADRs | commands, safety, provider/import boundaries, settled constraints |
| Product intent | `docs/prd.md` | users, behavior, non-goals, acceptance criteria |
| Current system | `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api.md`, then code | implemented topology and interfaces; code evidence wins stale prose |
| Approved change | `docs/plan.md`, linked `docs/initiatives/*.md` | future execution and migration sequence, not current-state claims |
| Visual direction | `docs/design.md` | brand, UI, and visual-system decisions |
| Session state | `docs/handoff.md` | resume snapshot only |
| Historical context | `docs/archive/*` | never current authority |

`docs/decisions.md` and ADRs constrain every domain they explicitly address. A plan
cannot override a locked ADR, and an architecture document cannot claim unimplemented
plan work is current. The conflicting doc is brought into line as a **drafted** edit
under per-edit confirmation — never silently. If the domain authorities still conflict,
or code and docs disagree without a settled decision, stop and surface the conflict.

## Superseded content & retired terminology

- **Superseded banner.** Overtaken content kept in place for context gets a top
  banner: `> **Superseded YYYY-MM-DD:** replaced by <doc/section> — kept for
  context.` Distinct from the archive banner (which marks a file *moved* to
  `docs/archive/`). No active doc carries obsolete direction without one of the two.
- **Retired terminology (optional).** A repo may keep a `## Retired terminology`
  table in AGENTS.md mapping dead terms to replacements; `repo-align` greps managed
  docs for stray uses. Project-supplied — no terms are hardcoded. Vocabulary-profile
  synonym checks use the same sweep mechanism with configurable terms and severity.

## Executable repository contract

Applicable `AGENTS.md` files and optional `.rad-repo.json` define validation
commands. Root instructions are defaults; closest-scope overlays add only materially
different commands or constraints. `repo_contract.py` resolves this map for changed
paths. `pre_ship.py` inspects staged Git blobs and blocks secrets, protected paths,
unexpected generated output, oversized files, missing/failed validation, and
unreviewed contract changes. Heuristic doc scans do not substitute for code checks.

## Non-goals

No status/roadmap/general implementation-plan/per-feature status docs. The controlled
initiative exception above is only for an approved finite migration. No `docs/inbox/`
staging tier. No separate ADR directory. No doc scaffolding "for later" — a shelf doc exists
only after its trigger fires. No dashboards or per-session logs. No writing durable
content without confirmation. Every required write stays under a minute or it won't
survive contact with a real Tuesday.
